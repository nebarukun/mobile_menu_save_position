# Mobile Menu Save Position

## Description

If you open the navigation on mobile view, then the current position is stored in the JavaScript and passed to the css.

When you close the navigation you are automatically scrolled back to where you were, but the user doesn't notice anything.

The advantage of this is that when you open and close the mobile navigation you always stay on the current position and not back at the top of the page.
